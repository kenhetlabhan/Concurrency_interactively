                Lock-based Concurrent Data Structures 
                Adding locks to a data structure makes the structure thread-safe, therefore the data structure is usable by threads and leads to a high-yielding performance. There are several different structures: Counters, Linked-lists, Queues, and Hash Tables.
            </p>            
            <p>
                There are 2 different types of counters:
            </p>            
            <p>
                Concurrent counter:
            </p>           
            <p>
                Counter: A device or function that stores the number of times equal values are added or events have occurred
            </p>            
            <p>
                Counter with locks: When a routine is called, a lock is acquired, and it is released when the call is returned.
            </p>           
            <p>
                 Perfect scaling: Threads complete work on processors in parallel.
            </p>            
            <p>
                Approximate Counter: Helps counter the issue of bugs in counter scalability on multicore machines.
                
            </p>           
            <p>
                A single logical counter using multiple local physical counters, one per CPU core, and a single global counter. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A lock per local physical counter and the global counter.

            </p>
            <p>
                Concurrent linked lists:
                Linked lists: An ordered structure which consists of nodes which have an element and a pointer
            
            <p>
                The issue with concurrent linked lists: Failure of function causes the lock to be released and must undo all the states before returning, causing bugs. Only surrounding locks and releases around the critical code area.
            </p>          
            <p>
                Scaling linked lists: Hand over-hand locking (Lock coupling)
            </p>
            <p>
                Concurrent queues:
                Queue: First in first out system which orders a sequence of operations.
                Two locks to enable concurrency of enqueue and dequeue operations.
            </p>           
            <p>
                Concurrent hash table:mIt uses a lock per hash bucket for better performance.
                Many concurrent operations are taking plac
