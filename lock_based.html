            <h1>About Lock-based Concurrency:</h1>
            <p>
                By adding locks to a data structure it makes the structure thread safe, therefore the datastructure is usable by threads. It also makes it having a high yielding performance and multi-thread access to data structures. There are several different structures: Counters, Linked-lists, Queues and Hash Tables.

                There are 2 different types of counters:
                Concurrent counter:
                Counter: A device or function that stores the amount of times equal values are added or events have occurred
                Counter with locks: When a routine is called, a lock is acquired, and it is released when the call is returned.
                 Perfect scaling: Threads complete work on processors in parallel.
                Approximate Counter:
                Helps counter the issue of bugs in counter scalability on multicore machines.
                A single logical counter using multiple local physical counters, one per CPU core, and a single global counter. 
                A lock per local physical counter and the global counter.
                
                Concurrent linked lists:
                Linked lists: An ordered structured which consists of nodes which has an element and a pointer
                Issue with concurrent linked lists: Failure of function causes the lock to be released and must undo all the state before returning, causing bugs.
                Only surrounding locks and releases around the critical code area.
                Scaling linked lists: Hand over hand locking (Lock coupling)
                
                Concurrent queues:
                Queue: First in first out system which orders a sequence of operations.
                Two locks to enable concurrency of enqueue and dequeue operations.
                In the common case, the enqueue routine will only access the tail lock, and dequeue only the head lock.
                Queues are commonly used in mutli-threaded applications
                
                Concurrent hash table:
                It uses a lock per hash bucket for a better performance.
                Many concurrent operations are taking place.
